                        <p>I just finished my secondary school with deciding to study computer science, art as well as all of the necessary subjects. Picking art as a GCSE was one of my worst decisions I made - <b>ever</b>. For 2 years I found it quite difficult to find time to work on the coursework and I usually found myself falling behind everyone else. All I can say that my art teacher was absolutely amazing and helped me with my journey throughout - <u>this one's for you Triple B</u> 
                        </p>
                        <p>Apart from computer science and art, the subjects that really enjoyed at school were maths and chemistry. My maths teacher taught me for 5 continuous years with a couple of lessons with other teachers dotted in between. I just really enjoy working with numbers. However, I enjoy chemistry as I consider myself to be quite an inquisitive person, and with chemistry I discovered something new about the surrounding we live in everyday (that and also because of all of the equations).</p>

                        <p>My programming adventure started mid-way through 2018. My ICT teacher introduces the whole class to Python. Up to that point, I was already quite interested in starting to learn a programming language, as my dad always told me that it is a very useful skill. At the very beginnning, my main interest with programming was making games. I really wanted to make my own games. My drive behind this most likely came from all of the video games I played (such as <b>Minecraft</b>, <b>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</b>, and my favourite game up to date, <b>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</b>). I remember that the very first big project I started working on was a remake of The Witcher 1 into a python text adventure (I basically forgot about it. I still need to finish it someday ;-;). And from then, I started developing my python skills into different various things, moving away from games.</p>
                        <p>Due to my love for creating games, one day I decided that I want to learn a new programming language, <b>C++</b>. My reasoning behind this was that a some of the big game engines use C++ (such as <b>Unreal Engine</b> or <b>Unity</b> whicih uses a slightly altered version of the C language, called <b>C#</b>). I plan to develop my C++ skills to the level of my python ability. First I want to learn basic, text-orientated C++ and hopefully one day I'd like to advance to visual C++. On top of all of this, after learning C++ to a good enough point, I'd like to learn <b>Java</b>. I don't have a particular reason behind doing so, but although I heard that it's quite hard at first, it's used a lot in different things.</p>

                        <p>This is a hobby that I had for a very long time now. I find creating my own characters, personalities, whole worlds very very amusing. It really opens up your imagination and it allows your creativity to be captured on a piece of paper. I get a lot of my inspiration from <b>The Witcher</b> series by one of my favourite writers of all time - <b>Andrzej Sapkowski</b>. Due to this, I really enjoy writing fantasy, but even more, dark fantasy stories. I regularly write around 2 short stories around twice a week. I also have a fanfiction.net account (it's pretty old though) where I tried to write a fan fiction about an anime called "Fairy Tail", but it seems like I've deleted them. For the curious amongst you, I have the only 2 chapters that I ever wrote in a download button below - <b>please don't bully me</b>. The reason why it was so unsuccessful in my opinion is due to the lack of an actual plan. One day I just started writing about something that I enjoyed and then realised that I was making all of it as I was going along. Nowadoys I feel a lot more confident and happy about my writing, so if you want to go check out some of my stories, go <a href="../writing/"><u>here</u>.</p>

Jeopardy-style CTFs has a couple of questions (tasks) in range of categories. For example, Web, Forensic, Crypto, Binary or something else. Team can gain some points for every solved task. More points for more complicated tasks usually. The next task in chain can be opened only after some team solve previous task.

                        <p>I'm actually quite new to the whole concept of a CTF. One day in my computer science lesson, my friend Tom (go check out his <a href="http://www.tdpain.net"><b>website</b></a>) comes up to me and ask if I want to become a part of his CTF team. I was very clueless about the situation so he showed be an example, a very basic example. The whole problem was based on an SQL injection. He told me to do it and after 10 minutes of blankly staring at the screen I gave up. He then explained to me step by step the process of an SQL injection. At that point my mind exploded. I instantly joined his CTF team under the name of <b>ProgPilot</b>. The first CTF that we participated together was the X-MAS 2019 CTF - you can check it out <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/926"><b>here</b></a>. I quickly found myself enjoying the forensics section as well as steganography, whilst Tom really enjoyed web. I really enjoy doing these CTF's because they're fun, but also you learn a lot from them.</p>
